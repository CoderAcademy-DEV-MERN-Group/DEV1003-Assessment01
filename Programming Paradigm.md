# Programming Paradigm

## Hybrid Approach: OOP Backend with Functional Frontend

At this stage of our application's development we are planning to use a hybrid approach of programming paradigms, choosing the most appropriate for different layers of the application:

- **Backend (Node.js, Express, Mongoose):** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Frontend (React):** Functional Programming with Hooks

For the purposes of this assessment, we will provide a thorough explanation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as it is the foundation of our data models and application logic.

## Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm which structures code into objects rather than functions and logic. An object or class (these terms are often interchangable) bundles related data (attributes) and behaviours (methods) into modular units, aligning with real world entities and their relationships. OOP promotes code organisation, reusability and maintainability through abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism (more on those terms below!)

### The Four Pillars of OOP

The four key principles of OOP are referred to as _The Four Pillars_. They are a set of rules to follow when creating an application, in order to help write clean, efficient and maintainable codebases. Let's discuss The Four Pillars in detail below.

#### Abstraction

Essentially, this is ensuring that overcomplicated details of your code are "hidden away". Abstraction is essential to keeping your code dry, as

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the major benefit of using OOP in our MERN project. Mongoose models and schemas will allow us to create modular functionality for each entity.

#### Inheritance

#### Polymorphism
