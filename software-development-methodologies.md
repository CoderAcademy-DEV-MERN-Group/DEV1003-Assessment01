# Software Development Methodologies

This document summarises the **Software Development Methodologies** chosen for our group’s **MERN Full-Stack project: "The Century Screening Room"**.

Software Development Methodologies provide structured approaches to planning, organising, and delivering software projects. They guide how teams collaborate, prioritise tasks, and adapt to change throughout the development lifecycle to ensure projects are efficient, consistent and maintainable [GeeksforGeeks, 2025](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/what-is-software-development-methodology-15-key-methodologies/).

## Chosen Methodologies

For this project, we evaluated several approaches and selected a combination of two complementary methodologies that provide a balance of structure with adaptability and provide our team with a clear framework for iterative planning, collaboration and visual task tracking while supporting feedback-driven iteration and continuous improvement [Atlassian, 2025](https://www.atlassian.com/agile).

1. **Agile Project Management Methodology** - sets the cadence for planning, iteration, reviews, and retrospectives so the team can adapt to change and learn continuously.

2. **Kanban Task Management Methodology** - provides the visual flow of work in Trello (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review/QA → Done), with implemented work in progress (WIP) limits to expose bottlenecks and improve continuous flow of tasks.

This combination provides the overarching rhythm of Agile with the visual clarity of Kanban, encouraging collaborative accountability and transparent progress tracking.

We chose this approach because it aligns well with our project scope, small team size, collaborative workflow, and assessment timelines and helps guide us in managing changing requirements as our project evolves, while also supporting communication, transparency and accountability.

## Agile Project Management Methodology

Agile provides an iterative, feedback-driven framework suited to small teams building modular software components. It enables the team to continuously plan, implement, review, and improve features across project phases, ensuring adaptability as new requirements evolve.

## Agile Core Principles

Agile focuses on **iteration, collaboration, and adaptability**, supported by the following principles:

1. **Iterative Development:** Work will be divided into short 1 week sprints with defined deliverables. Each sprint will end with a peer review and retrospective.
2. **Continuous Collaboration:** Team communication will occur through Slack and GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). Every feature branch will be peer reviewed before merging to main branch to maintain version control.
3. **Responding to Change:** Tasks may be reprioritised based on sprint feedback or testing outcomes.
4. **Deliver Working Software Frequently:** Each sprint aims to deliver testable components—for example, functional API routes or validated models.

Agile promotes transparency and consistent delivery [Atlassian, 2025](https://www.atlassian.com/agile).

# Kanban Task Management Methodology

Kanban provides a visual system for tracking progress, limiting work in progress (WIP), and maintaining a continuous delivery flow. We implement Kanban using **Trello Kanban Board** to manage task cards through different stages of development, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout each project phase.

## Core Kanban Principles

Kanban focuses on visualising workflow, limiting WIP and optimising flow. These principles ensure that tasks move efficiently from start to completion without overloading our team members.

1. **Visualise Workflow:** Tasks are represented as cards on a Trello board, moving between columns that reflect progress.
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** Each team member will maintain no more than three active tasks at a time to prevent context switching.
3. **Manage Flow:** Progress will be reviewed in daily stand-ups and retrospectives to identify bottlenecks.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** The board will evolve across phases to suit project needs and team feedback.

These principles are based on industry practices from [Atlassian: Kanban Principles, 2025](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/kanban-principles).
